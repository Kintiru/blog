## polarilty of molecules

Difference electronegativity causes the partial charge in molecules which makes the molecule polar

### Notation

Denote partial charge of each atom using
$\delta+$ and $\delta-$

or use vector-like notation arrow at the bottom of the molecule towards the more electronegative element.
