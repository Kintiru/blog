# Chapter 7

## Light and wave

Light is a electromagnetic wave that has the properties below.

Wavelength (Î»): Wavelength is how much distance per cycle.

Frequency (f): Frequency is many cycles per seconds.

Velocity (m/s)

## Electron configuration

### Notation

```
1s
2s 2p
3s 3p 3d
4s 4p 4d 4f
5s 5p 5d 5f 5g
```

We read it diagonal from right to left.
For example,

1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s ...

We can also denote the number of electrons using superscript at the end of each term like below.

1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup>  ...

**Note**: Perodic table is constructed in a way to accomodate this order.

there are 4 variables to represent electronic configuration
| Letter        | Representation                   | Possible values  |   |   |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------------|---|---|
| n             | Principal quantum number         | $1,2,3,\cdots$   |   |   |
| l             | Angular momentum quantum number  | $0,\cdots,n-1$           |   |   |
| m<sub>l</sub>  | Magnetic quantum number          | $2l+1$             |   |   |
| m<sub>s</sub> | Spin quantum number              | $+1/2, -1/2$              |   |   |

#### Principal quantum number

Represents electron shell.

#### Angular momentum quantum number

Represents subshell within a shell.

| l | subshell letter |
|---|---|
| 0 | s |
| 1 | p |
| 2 | d |
| 3 | f |

#### magnetic quantum number

Represents orbital in a subshell.

Number of orbitals within a subshell is $2l+1$, which is $-l,\cdots,0,\cdots,l$.
1
For example, in the p subshell which is $l=1$, the number of orbitals is $2\cdot1+1 = 3$ which the possible orbitals are $-1,0,1$.

d subshell which is $l=2$, the number of orbitals is $2\cdot2+1 = 5$ which the possible orbitals are $-2,-1,0,1,2$.

#### Spin quantum number

Represents the spin of the electron. There are 2 electron with different spin in a single orbital.

Using the example from above, the possible spin within an orbital is $+1/2, -1/2$, so the number of electrons in the p subshell is $3\cdot2 = 6$.

### Aufbau's law

### Hund's rule

### Paramagnetic and diamagnetic

#### Paramagnetic

para - parallel (unpaired)

paramagnetic means that there is at least one unpaired electrons. Most of the elements in periodic table is paramagnetic due to [Hund's rule](#hunds-rule)

#### diamagnetic

### Isoelectronic

Means same number of electrons. Isoelectronic ions have same number of electrons. (e.g Na<sup>+</sup> and F<sup>-</sup>)

## Electrons and Ionization Energy

### Inner, Outer, and Valance electron

#### Inner electron

#### Outer electron

#### valance electron

### Ionization energy

Ionization energy is the energy required to remove a mol of electron from one mol of atoms.
