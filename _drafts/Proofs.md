## Statement
Statement is an assertion that is true or false but not both

### Negation
Negation of $P$ is denoted as $\sim P$

### Open statement

: an open statement $P(x)$ involves variable that is yet determined.

For example, lets say we have a statement $P(x)$

$P: x^2 > 1$.

Depending on $x$, the statement may be true or false.

Therefore, we need quantifiers for $x$, such as $\forall x \in \mathbb{R}$.

Now let's see the open statement again.

## Truth Set
Truth set is a set of $x$ that makes open statement $P(x)$ true.
