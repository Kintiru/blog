# Ch.9 Chemical bonding

Chemical bonding occurs by interaction between atoms and their valance electron

Quick review for Valance Electron:
 - Electrons in highest $n$ values in incomplete shell
 - Electrons in incomplete $d$ or $f$ orbitals.

### Lewis Diagram

Lewis Diagram is a diagram that represents the atom and valance electrons.

### Lattice Energy

Lattice energy is the energy due to electrostatic attraction between ions.

Electric Potential energy is as below.

$$k\frac{q_1q_2}{r}$$

Therefore, Lattice energy is
- Propertional to charge
- Inversly proportional to radius/distance (size of the atoms)

For example,
| Compound | Lattice Energy (kJ/mol) |
|---|---|
| LiCl | highest |
| NaCl | |
| KCl | lowest |


Among these ionic compounds, 

Lithium has the smallest size, thus it has the highest Lattice Energy

Potassium has the largest size, thus it has the lowest Lattice Energy
