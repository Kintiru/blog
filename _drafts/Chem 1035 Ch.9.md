# Ch.9 Chemical bonding

Chemical bonding occurs by interaction between atoms and their valance electron

Quick review for Valance Electron:
 - Electrons in highest $n$ values in incomplete shell
 - Electrons in incomplete $d$ or $f$ orbitals.

### Lewis Diagram

Lewis Diagram is a diagram that represents the atom and valance electrons.

### Lattice Energy

Lattice energy is the energy due to electrostatic attraction between ions.

Electric Potential energy is as below.

$$E = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r} = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r_1+r_2}$$

Since r is radius from center of an atom to the center of another atom, it is sum of radius of two atoms, $r=r_1+r_2$

Therefore, Lattice energy is
- Propertional to charge
- Inversly proportional to radius/distance (size of the atoms)

For example,
| Compound | Lattice Energy (kJ/mol) |
|---|---|
| LiCl | highest |
| NaCl | |
| KCl | lowest |


Among these ionic compounds, 

Lithium has the smallest size, thus it has the highest Lattice Energy

Potassium has the largest size, thus it has the lowest Lattice Energy

### Electronegativity

The ability of an atom in bond to attract electron pair

$\Delta EN$ 

### Bond

#### Bond order

Number of bonds

We see 4 bonds of equivalent of length, energy, order

S=O

Bond order = number of bonds / locations

Example

SO<sub>4</sub>

b.o = 6/4 = 1.5

#### Bond energy

How much energy does bond has (strength of bond)

### Formal Charge

Valance - dots - bonds

Example (CCl<sub>4</sub>)

* C: 4 - 0 - 4 = 0 
* Cl : 7 - 6 - 1 = 0

No Formal Charge greater or less than $\pm 1$

(can exist but very unlikely statiscally)

In structure, maximize 0 formal charges.

More negative charge to more electronegative atom

### Overloading electrons

Can overload electrons on most atoms, but not allowed for period 1 and 2

### Geometry

#### Electron Geometry

Electron Geometry is the geometry of an atom including electrons.

Therefore, it includes lone pair

#### Shape of molecule

Only counts atoms
