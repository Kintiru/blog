# Types of Exceptions

## Compile Time Exception

Exceptions are checked during compile time

To be compiled successfully, the code must handle exception

 * Try Catch
 * Throw Exception

Otherwise, it will throw an exception during compile.
  

## Runtime Exception

Runtime exceptions are not checked during compile.

Therefore, the developer must be able to except exceptions and be able to handle them

Most common exceptions are `NullPointerException`

> NullPointerException happens when trying to access a null object
{: .prompt-info }

# Throwing an Exception

see example below

```Java
throw new Exception();
throw new NullPointerException();
```

You can include message too.

```Java
throw new Exception("some message 1");
throw new NullPointerException("some message 2");
```

# Handling Exceptions

## Try, Catch, finally

There can be multiple catch block for try catch.

It is usual to go from specific exception to general exception. (see example below)

```java
try{
    //code
}
catch(NullPointerException e) {
    //handle error
}
catch(Exception e) {
    //handle error
}
```

finally block runs even if the exception is not handled.

Thus, it can be used for cleanup process.

## Postponding Exceptions

See the example below

```java
public void someFunction() throws NullPointerException {
    // code
}
```

# Note for CS2114 students

You should test exception if you have exception handling code in your test.
